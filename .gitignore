# This repo is in the home directory because there are some scripts there
# that we want to track. Because of that, we need a pretty aggressive
# .gitignore, so that only the config files we want to track are tracked
# and not everything else that might end up in my home directory

# Ignore everything
/*

# Except for...
# this file
!.gitignore
# .config directory
!.config
# startup script for sway
!sway-run
# miscellaneous scripts
!.scripts
